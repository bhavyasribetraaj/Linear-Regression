This project implements **simple and multiple linear regression** models in Python using the [Housing Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction).  
The goal is to predict housing prices based on features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc., and evaluate model performance.
